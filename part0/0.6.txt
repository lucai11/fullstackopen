note over browser:
when submit is pressed, default submit of a form is suppressed by JS. 
instead, JS takes value of form, and creates a JS object with new date
it pushes object to array, clears the form value, and calls
redrawNotes and sendToServer
end note
note over browser: 
redrawNotes creates UL, adds all notes as li children (including newly pushed one)
if had other children, remove them to not duplicate list
end note
note over browser: 
sendToServer parses newest note and makes post request
end note
browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: response: {"message":"note created"}
